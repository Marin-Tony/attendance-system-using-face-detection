# attendance-system-using-face-detection
This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence, time-in, and time-out of students teachers and staff.
It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition, along with the development of a web application to cater to various use cases of the system such as registration of new students and staff, addition of photos to the training dataset, viewing attendance reports, etc.
This report explains the libraries and machine learning based models and algorithms that have been used for facial detection and recognition.
Use of Django, along with an SQLite database for web application development and database management has been provided.
This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. 
It can be used in schools, colleges and organizations where security is essential.
